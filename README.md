# MuteWindowHotkey
 GUI to map Xbox One controller buttons to running applications to mute them on hold.
 This App starts in the tray. To access the GUI, click the blue icon in the tray. It is intended to add this to your autostart folder. I personally use this to mute my Nintendo DS emulator when i use the speed up function, to save my ears from terrible sped up audio.
